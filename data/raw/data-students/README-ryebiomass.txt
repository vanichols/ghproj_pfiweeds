Rye biomass was sampled at the Boyd farm by Mickala Stallman and I. 
The plots going into corn (Boyd 44, south plots) were sampled April 23, plots going into soy (Boyd 42, north plots) were sampled May 3. 
We used a quadrat from the Bruner shed, approximately 32" by 12". We sampled from row to row, 2 samples per plot (rye was very uniform). 
We should have straddled the yield row with the quadrat. Next time. 
We sampled every plot that had rye (so both silage and grain rotations). 
Biomass was dried at 60deg C for at least 48 hours.
